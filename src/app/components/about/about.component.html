            The greenest greens and the bluest blues come alive at Park View. 
            An unprecedented package of everything that a traveler may demand comes together to 
            make Park View the most distinguished name among Coorg resorts. <br>
            While Coorg is famous for its dreamy landscapes, misty mornings, and lush forests, 
            Park View takes it a step forward with the most elegant cottages, a bevy of modern comforts,
            and a private waterfall. Imagine staying at the best resorts in Coorg and witness the
             magnificence of Coorgâ€™s natural splendor every moment of every day. Park View takes 
             all the stress away by providing not only well-furnished cottages but also private space 
             to enjoy the best of Coorg. It includes decadent mountain views from private balconies in 
             the cottages, a babbling brook running throughout the property, an infinity pool with 
             unhindered views of the private roaring waterfall, and much more. <br>
            For the culinary aficionados, the multi-cuisine restaurant provides more than ample 
            satisfaction, while workaholics can take advantage of the well-equipped conference room.
